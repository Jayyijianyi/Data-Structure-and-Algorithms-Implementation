# Learning and Implementing Data Structure and Algorithms
## My progressive learning on data structure and algorithms in different programming language.

In this repository, I am going to document my code of implementing different learned algorithms in various programming language with description to understand my work better.

### 1. _Bubble Sort Algorithm_


**Implementation of code:**  
1. [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/Jayyijianyi/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/Bubble%20Sort%20in%20Java/Bubble_Sort.java) and [Optimized Bubble Sort](https://github.com/Jayyijianyi/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/Bubble%20Sort%20in%20Java/Optimized_Bubble_Sort.java) in Java from [geeksforgeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)

**Problems that I have solved:** 
1. [Function Problem](https://github.com/Jayyijianyi/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/master/Bubble%20Sort%20in%20Java/Bubble_Sorting_Problem.java) in Java from [geeksforgeeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org/problems/bubble-sort/1)


**Worst and Average Case Time Complexity**: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

**Best Case Time Complexity**: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.
